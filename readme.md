# OSGeo-App

## About Me

Hey folks, 
I am Swapnadeep Mohapatra from Odisha, India. I read in class 10. I have 2 years of coding experience making Android Apps and Web Apps. But it's my first time participating in Google Code-in.

Contributing to OSGeo is really a great experience. I made Android App using Kotlin for the OSGeo projects. 

## What I did

The app displays a list of Projects of OSGeo fetched through an API. 

There is a splash screen which displays the logo of OSGeo.

On clicking on the more info button, the user can view a short description about the project along with some pictures.

The API made to fetch the lists of projects is made with Node.js. It uses MySQL as a database and is hosted using Heroku.

New data can be added to the API too.

## What I learned

I have been developing apps using Java but my experience with Kotlin limited to the classic Hello World app. But to work in OSGeo i had to develop app in Kotlin.

## Difficulties I faced.
